Create geometry using NodeBox 1 code.

This node already has the basic setup for NodeBox 1 by having a seed for controlling random values. See [controlling randomness](../using/randomness.md) to learn why you need a random seed.

Read the [NodeBox 1 documentation](http://nodebox.net/code/) to learn the NodeBox 1 API. You can use these commands in any NodeBox 2 node.
