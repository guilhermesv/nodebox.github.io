Create a line between one point and an angle + distance.

* **X**: The X coordinate of the starting point.
* **Y**: The Y coordinate of the starting point.
* **Angle**: The angle of the line, in degrees.
* **Distance**: The distance of the line.
* **Stroke**: The stroke color.
* **Stroke Width**: The stroke width. If the width is 0, the shape will have no stroke.
* **Points**: The amount of points to create along the path. This has the same effect as the [resample](resample.html) node.
