Template for creating new nodes that manipulate vector data.

This node serves as a base template and has no parameters. To add parameters, click the Metadata button in the Parameters pane. From there you can add, remove and re-order parameters.

This node is only useful if you want to [program your own nodes](../advanced/programming-nodes.html).
