Shift points or paths by a random amount.

* **Scope**: The level of objects at which to wiggle. This can be 
* **Wiggle X**: The maximum distance the X coordinate can change.
* **Wiggle Y**: The maximum distance the Y coordinate can change.
* **Seed**: The [random variation](../using/randomness.html).

Notes
-----
* Wiggle shifts point in both directions: a wiggle X of 50.00 means a point can shift between -25.00 and 25.00.
