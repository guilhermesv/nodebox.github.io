Fit a shape within bounds.

You can define the shape using the x, y, width, height parameters, or by connecting a template shape that fit will try to match.

* **X**: The X position of the bounding box.
* **X**: The Y position of the bounding box.
* **Width**: The width of the bounding box.
* **Height**: The height of the bounding box.
* **Keep Proportions**: If turned off fit will stretch your shape to match the bounding box.
