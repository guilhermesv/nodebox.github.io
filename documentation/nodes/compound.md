Add, subtract or intersect geometry. Use boolean operations similar to Illustrator's Pathfinder feature.

* **Function**: The boolean operation to perform on the input geometries:
  * *Union*: Add two shapes together.
  * *Difference*: Subtract one shape from another.
  * *Intersect*: Take what the two shapes have in common.
* **Invert Difference**: Invert the input of shape A and B. Only useful in difference and intersect.
* **Fill**: The fill color. If the alpha value is 0, the shape will have no fill.
* **Stroke**: The stroke color.
* **Stroke Width**: The stroke width. If the width is 0, the shape will have no stroke.
