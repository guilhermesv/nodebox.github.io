Delete points or paths that lie within certain bounds. The bounds can be defined by connecting a template shape. If no shape is connected, delete uses the x / y / width / height values. 

* **Scope**: Delete individual points or whole paths. Paths are selected once one of their point falls within the bounding shape.
* **Operation**: Choose between deleting selected or unselected points.
* **X**: The X coordinate of the bounding shape.
* **X**: The X coordinate of the bounding shape.
* **Width**: The width of the bounding shape.
* **Height**: The height of the bounding shape.
