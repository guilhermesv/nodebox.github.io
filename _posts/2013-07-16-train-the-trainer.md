EMRG/NodeBox invites you to a “Train the Trainer” session on October 21-22-23, 2013 at the premises of EMRG, St-Jozefsstraat 35, 2018 Antwerp, Belgium.

In this comprehensive training course you will learn how NodeBox works from the inside out, with a solid understanding of the fundamentals, so you can confidently teach it afterwards.

NodeBox is a great application for creating generative design and data visualizations using a visual, node-based approach. By learning directly from its creators, you get the best possible preparation for giving classes yourself.

Who is it for?
--------------
All teachers working in generative art & design who are interested in coaching NodeBox 3 workshops.

What will you get?
Personal training by the NodeBox developer team.
Insight in the present and future of NodeBox.
Access to workshop materials.
Tips and tricks from our experience in teaching programming skills to art/design  students.
Qualification to give NodeBox workshops.

Requirements?
-------------
Your own laptop (Mac or PC).
Experience using NodeBox 3.
Coding experience is helpful, but not required.
Training is in English, but the NodeBox team speaks some Dutch, German, Spanish and French, too.

Price?
------
For this three day training we charge €350. Included: course material, beverages (coffee, tea, water, etc.) and lunch.
Not included: travel/lodging. If you are interested we can provide you with tips.
Good to know: Integrated2013, the design conference is happening on 24/25 of October, in case you need one extra reason to come to Antwerp.

Programme:
---------
Day 1: We will refresh the basics of NodeBox 3 and dive into the system core: how list processing works, how to create and distribute networks and libraries, how to attach custom code to nodes. We will show you the best way to find documentation and help, straight from the source.

Day 2: Pattern
What do we want to visualize? Where can we get data? What can we learn from it? This course is an introduction to data mining using basic techniques from natural language processing, machine learning and statistical analysis. 
We will use the [Pattern module for Python](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pattern), so programming experience is encouraged.

Day 3: 
We examine examples and case studies in NodeBox 3 and Pattern and discuss what worked and what did not.

Symposium
---------
Every day at 6pm, workshop attendees will have the opportunity to present their own activities in a 15-minute presentation. The aim of the symposium is to promote interdisciplenary discourse, so we welcome all proposals. Speakers are asked to submit a 100-word abstract and a short bio in advance. Presentations are open to the public and will be announced on social media and to the students of the St. Lucas University College of Art & Design.
