[Valence](http://organisms.be/index.php/valence) was presented at the 2012 edition of Interieur â€” the [European Design Biennale](http://www.interieur.be/) taking place in Kortrijk.

Valence was located at the [Future Form Lab](http://www.interieur.be/programme/future-form-lab) at Buda Factory. 

Roomies were [Unfold](http://unfold.be/pages/projects), [Noumenon](http://www.noumenon.eu/) and [MGX](http://www.mgxbymaterialise.com/) (who supplied the lights).

In addition to the previous version a way to control the ambient lightning of the room was implemented to the system. 

A [Loxone module](http://www.loxone.com/) was used to control the lights over udp. 

[Tim Augustynen](http://www.rockstarrecordings.be/) gave us a big help to configure that one and with building the electronic circuit for the lights.
