For a recent [data visualisation workshop in The Hague](/gallery/2012/11/workshop-the-hague/), we needed a way to import MIDI files into NodeBox 3.

MIDI has some "interesting" properties: each note is stored as two separate "on" and "off" events that need to be matched up to find the duration. Getting this right is non-trivial; that's why this work might be interesting to other people as well.

MIDI data comes into NodeBox as a standard table (similar to CSV data), and individual columns can be selected using the [lookup node](/node/reference/data/lookup.html).
