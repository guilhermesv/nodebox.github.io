An experiment with Nodebox output to a cnc laser cutter. 

The idea was to make a fossile with a (heavy) laser cutter and use Nodebox to generate the model in.

The centipede-like structure is a generative design made by using mainly core nodes and functionality. 
The math behind the skeleton was done over an additional python file that renders [Voronoi segmentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram). 
The skeleton itself is the [medial axis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_axis) path derived from that segmentation.

The cnc laser cutter (we could use one at a local [fab lab](http://www.fablabgenk.be/)) was set to engraving and expects a png file. The variation in graycolor is translated to depth by the machine.

Here is a [step by step tutorial on instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Centipede-fossiles/) on creating the centipede. You can download all files at the end of the last step.
