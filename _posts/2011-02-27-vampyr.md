# Contemporary music + real-time generative art

Vampyr! is an extended solo for guitar created by the French composer Tristan Murail (°1947). It has a distorted rock sound – but captured in sheet music as a classical piece. Graphic designer & musician Laura Broux has created a generative NodeBox installation for the piece. The installation responds to sound in real-time, resulting in a unique live performance. 

The video features Nico Coeck on guitar, testing the setup.
Laura and Nico will perform on March 19th 2011 at deSingel International Arts Campus (Antwerp, BE)  and on May 8th 2011 in the Museum of Modern Arts (Antwerp, BE). More info at champdaction.be.
