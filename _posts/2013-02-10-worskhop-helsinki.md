We did a workshop at [Aalto University - Finland - Helsinki] (http://www.aalto.fi/en/) from 4 till 8 march 2013. Participants were a selection of students from graphic design and media arts. The focus was on data visualization.

Below are some of the final results. To see the process you can visit the [workshop blog](http://workshops.nodebox.net/2013-helsinki/).

Days of the Tentacle
-----------------------
<div class="by">Toni Enstrom</div>

The idea here was to use data from the walkthrough instructions of a classic 2d adventure game to build a poster visualization out of that. The result is a walkthrough guide to the adventure game ["Day of the Tentacle"] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Tentacle).

The reading of the visualization starts from the gap in the circle, and continues clockwise, line by line. each line tells three things: 
(1) which playable character does  
(2) what action and 
(3) where

Un / Healthy
-----------------------
<div class="by">Itari Niitamo</div>


Basic idea was to create an infographic that juxtaposes healthy and unhealthy habits in daily life.

Healthy:
+ Amount of exercise per week
+ Percentage of vegetables in meals
+ Happiness index

Unhealthy:
+ Obesity
+ Cigarette-smoking
+ Hours in a day watching TV

The final result displays the Happiness index and BMI for the top 20 countries in both categories.

Maritime Activity
-----------------------
<div class="by">Minna Piirainen</div>

A classic map visualization with commercial ports, vessels and their routes. The set contains data from 14 vessels and their activity during one month. Data is available at [marinetraffic.com](http://marinetraffic.com)

Time Travel Plots
-----------------------
<div class="by">Palash Mukhopadhyay</div>

This visualization works on a datasheet on time travels in popular movies and television shows. The data can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aqe2P9sYhZ2ncFliSmVvb2dwRk5fcy1peHVsSDRvYnc&hl=en_GB#gid=0).

It shows information about:
+ who made the time travel. 
+ the start and end date of the time travel
+ the reason for travelling into time
+ the method/means used to travel into time.

The final result was quite big and needed zooming in / out because some of the protagonist made huge time jumps. (f.i the Red dwarf crew going back to 1963 from the year 30000000.)

Obesity Worldwide
-----------------------
<div class="by">BÃ¡rbara Paz Rebolledo Bustamante</div>

A visualization on obesity which works with data found on the [guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2013/feb/19/obesity-map-of-world-weight) website.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) database contains global comparisons of overweight and obesity for men and women. The final result maps the information on a circle where each spike is a country with an indication of obesity for men on the right side and for women on the left side of the spike. 
It also shows the trend from 2000 - 2012.
